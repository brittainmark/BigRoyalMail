        <h1>Installation overview</h1>
        <p>This module installs in much the same way as other modules. Simply
            copy the "includes" and "image" folders to your online store
            directory. <br>Then go to modules / shipping in the store admin.
            For each of the methods you want to install, select that line and
            click [ Install ] <br>Next, click [ Edit] and switch it on
            (enable this shipping option "true")
        </p>
        <p>You may want to also switch on "Hide invalid shipping" so
            customers aren't show methods they can't use.</p>
        <p>The rates are the current RM charges, so are best left unchanged.
            If you want to add an amount for packaging cost, put that into the
            "Handling Fee" box. Then any changes in postage costs are easy to
            update.</p>
        <p>If the order total is more than a set amount, this shipping
            method won't be offered. To change this limit, alter the amount in
            the "Maximum order value" box. To disable the limit, enter -1 in the
            box.</p>
        <p>Some items are too big for certain postage methods. If you want to
            restrict the shipping options for a product, you assign a read only
            attribute to the item, which sets the "minimum" delivery method. Run
            the SQL file "install3.2.sql" which will set up the attribute
            values. <br>Then it is easy to use the Attribute Controller to
            assign the relevant postage methods to an item.
        </p>
        <p>If you read <a href="HowToUseAttributePricing.htm">HowToUseAttributePricing.htm</a>
            it lists how it works. <br>In the first table on that page,
            across the top there are the different attribute values you might
            have assigned to the item. Down the side are listed the modules that
            can be offered if that attribute is set. <br>To read the table,
            look down the column under the attribute you have set for an item,
            and the rows marked with Y show the delivery modules available for
            that product. <br>As you can see, if no attribute is set, all
            options are shown to customer. If you set an option, that and any
            "larger" options are shown. Further down the page there is another
            table. This is for when you have enabled "Attribute match" to "true"
            for specific delivery options. Only exact matches will be available,
            not giving the customer the option of a "bigger" alternative. For
            example, with "Attribute match" off, an item set to "large letter"
            would also show the option of "small parcel" and "medium parcel".
            With "attribute match" on, only "large letter" would be offered.
            Where items in the basket have different options, only the biggest
            one will be offered. Once you have assigned the relevant attribute
            value to an item, Zen Cart has a feature to copy that item's
            attributes to other items or to all items in specified categories.
            So if you start with an item with no other attributes, you can
            easily copy it around your store
        </p>

            </li>
            <li>If you want to force a minimum delivery method then set the
                appropriate attributes for each product. This can be done by
                visiting the product
                <ol class="l2">

        <p>NB.</p>
        <ol class="l1">
            <li>I have now change the modules to allow you to use
                attributes to determine the minimum delivery method for items
                (take some size into account). This does not take into account
                multiple items that when packed together would make the parcel
                larger than the size set. Therefore you may still need to
                consider which modules you install.</li>
            <li>All pricing information is based on Kg not Lbs. If you are
                using Lbs as your weight measure you will either have to adjust
                your product weights to Kg or recalculate the weights to Lbs.</li>
            <li>If you are using Kg and have not already done so adjust the
                <strong> TEXT_PRODUCTS_WEIGHT_UNIT</strong> to Kg to display the
                correct information in zen cart admin. This can be found in <strong>YOUR_SHOPPING_CART_DIRECTORY &gt; YOUR_ADMIN &gt; include &gt; language &gt; english.php</strong>
            </li>
            <li>As for 3) adjust the weight to TEXT_PRODUCTS_WEIGHT_UNIT to
                Kg. this should be found in <strong>CATALOG_SITE &gt; include &gt; language &gt; english.php</strong>
                or <strong>YOUR_SHOPPING_CART_DIRECTORY &gt; include &gt; language &gt; YOUR_TEMPLATE &gt; english.php</strong>.
                you should always save the changes to the second location to
                avoid them being lost on update.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you wish to modify any of the text in the language files please
            use the template overrides system. Copy the file to your template
            folder in the <strong>includes &gt; language &gt; english &gt; modules &gt; shipping &gt; YOUR_TEMPLATE</strong>
            this way you will not loose any changes if you install updates. As of Zen Cart 1.5.8 you only need to define the values you are changing.
            See <a href="https://tutorials.zen-cart.com/dev/code/158_language_files/">Zen Cart documentation</a>.

        <p>If you are using printer papers you can ship up to 5kg overseas.
            The upgrade SQL PrintedPapers.sql will apply the rates.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It will not differentiate between printed
            papers and other types of post so do not use this unless you know
            you are shipping printed papers. <br>Additionally you must have
            installed the full package before applying this update as it only
            changes the rates. See <strong>PrintedPapers.sql</strong> for how to
            apply.
        </p>
        <p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Canada and Cambodia have a max weight limit
            of 2Kg regardless.
