06/04/2009
Minor bug fix to Airmail Small Packets, when uninstalled and error was displayed in admin.
Major change in that parcelforce and all courier modules have now been removed and are to be found under ParcelForce shipping modules.

version 2.3.3
29/03/2009 :
Major change - all modules when installed are now "disabled" by default. The majority of "shop owners" are installing on live sites and so if they install a module it would appear on a customer's shopping trolley and checkout before the owner had a chance to check the figures or that the handling fees are correct.
New Modules - ukcourier, this is a very basic module for shop owners that want a basic courier module without going to the trouble of setting up zones and placing the Scottish Higlands in a separate pricing zone.
specialdeliverysat - This is BETA CODE, this module will appear to the customer after the post office has shut on a Thursday through to when it closes on a Friday, giving the option of Saturday Special Delivery, but it does rely on the server having the correct time and being in the UK, in the next release this will be corrected.
Module Update - Standard Parcels now has a minimum weight setting. THe royal mail calculates the price in a band from 0 to 2Kg, whereas some shop owners may prefer to send items by 1st Class up to a kilo and then offer standard parcels, this new setting enables this scenario and will be migrated across all modules.
Removals - the sql that removed all the royal mail details from the database adn the sql for when peopl upbraded version that were 2~3 years old has been removed from the optional section after a newbie ran it on his live site by mistake and damaged his installation.

version 2.3.2
15/03/2009 - All airmail countries have been altered to move from Royal Mail's 2006 definitions to 2009. Airsure countries have been corrected, The code base for Airmail and International Signed has been altered to create a cleaner more accurate code, reflecting the Royal Mail's change from Europe, World Zone 1 & World Zone 2, to Europe & the Rest of the World.
12/03/2009 - International Datapost, International Standard and Eurozone 48 all have to be upgraded because or a bug in the filename and bigroyal mail will not work unless the old files are removed before installing this release. See INSTALL.txt for the files to remove.
