            Mohan-Clarke aka Philip Clarke</h2>
        <p>Released under the GPL.</p>
        <h3>version 2.3.8</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">06/07/2009</li>
            <li>Added Royal Mail Surface Mail and Royal Mail Surface Mail
                International Signed For Modules.</li>
            <li class="da">03/06/2009</li>
            <li>Standard parcels (all 4 insurance versions) had a bug with
                the minimum weight for Guests using the shipping estimator so it
                would quote inappropriate rates and then when they logged in the
                rates would disappear.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>version 2.3.7</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">18/05/2009</li>
            <li>Airsure bug fixed where it was not detecting the &quot;rest
                of the world countries&quot;</li>
            <li>International Signed for upgraded to be able to exclude
                countries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>version 2.3.6</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">17/05/2009</li>
            <li>Bug fixes to royal mail standard parcels modules.</li>
            <li>Undefined constants errors removed in all Airmail modules.</li>
            <li>Beta - ability to exclude countries added to Airmail Small
                Packets</li>
            <li>Beta - Server Time correction now added to Special Delivery
                Saturday.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>version 2.3.5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">13/05/2009</li>
            <li>Bug fixes to royal mail standard parcels modules.</li>
            <li>optional shipping estimator code now upgraded to Zen Cart
                version 1.3.8a and re-arranged in directory to enable easier
                installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>version 2.3.4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">06/04/2009</li>
            <li>Minor bug fix to Airmail Small Packets, when uninstalled
                and error was displayed in admin.</li>
            <li>Major change in that Parcel Force and all courier modules
                have now been removed and are to be found under Parcel Force
                shipping modules.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>version 2.3.3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">29/03/2009 :</li>
            <li>Major change - all modules when installed are now
                &quot;disabled&quot; by default. The majority of &quot;shop
                owners&quot; are installing on live sites and so if they install
                a module it would appear on a customer's shopping trolley and
                checkout before the owner had a chance to check the figures or
                that the handling fees are correct.</li>
            <li>New Modules - ukcourier, this is a very basic module for
                shop owners that want a basic courier module without going to
                the trouble of setting up zones and placing the Scottish
                Highlands in a separate pricing zone.</li>
            <li>specialdeliverysat - This is BETA CODE, this module will
                appear to the customer after the post office has shut on a
                Thursday through to when it closes on a Friday, giving the
                option of Saturday Special Delivery, but it does rely on the
                server having the correct time and being in the UK, in the next
                release this will be corrected.</li>
            <li>Module Update - Standard Parcels now has a minimum weight
                setting. The royal mail calculates the price in a band from 0 to
                2Kg, whereas some shop owners may prefer to send items by 1st
                Class up to a kilo and then offer standard parcels, this new
                setting enables this scenario and will be migrated across all
                modules.</li>
            <li>Removals - the sql that removed all the royal mail details
                from the database and the sql for when people upgraded version
                that were 2~3 years old has been removed from the optional
                section after a newbie ran it on his live site by mistake and
                damaged his installation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>version 2.3.2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="da">15/03/2009</li>
            <li>All airmail countries have been altered to move from Royal
                Mail's 2006 definitions to 2009. Airsure countries have been
                corrected, The code base for Airmail and International Signed
                has been altered to create a cleaner more accurate code,
                reflecting the Royal Mail's change from Europe, World Zone 1
                &amp; World Zone 2, to Europe &amp; the Rest of the World.</li>
            <li class="da">12/03/2009</li>
            <li>International Datapost, International Standard and Eurozone
                48 all have to be upgraded because or a bug in the filename and
                bigroyal mail will not work unless the old files are removed
                before installing this release. See INSTALL.txt for the files to
                remove.</li>
