		<h2>Big_royalmail version 2.3.x - originally authored by Philip
			Mohan-Clarke aka Philip Clarke</h2>
		<p>Released under the GPL.</p>
		<h3>version 2.3.8</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">06/07/2009</li>
			<li>Added Royal Mail Surface Mail and Royal Mail Surface Mail
				International Signed For Modules.</li>
			<li class="da">03/06/2009</li>
			<li>Standard parcels (all 4 insurance versions) had a bug with
				the minimum weight for Guests using the shipping estimator so it
				would quote inappropriate rates and then when they logged in the
				rates would disappear.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.7</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">18/05/2009</li>
			<li>Airsure bug fixed where it was not detecting the "rest of
				the world countries"</li>
			<li>International Signed for upgraded to be able to exclude
				countries.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.6</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">17/05/2009</li>
			<li>Bug fixes to royal mail standard parcels modules.</li>
			<li>Undefined constants errors removed in all Airmail modules.</li>
			<li>Beta - ability to exclude countries added to Airmail Small
				Packets</li>
			<li>Beta - Server Time correction now added to Special Delivery
				Saturday.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.5</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">13/05/2009</li>
			<li>Bug fixes to royal mail standard parcels modules.</li>
			<li>optional shipping estimator code now upgraded to Zen Cart
				version 1.3.8a and re-arranged in directory to enable easier
				installation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.4</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">06/04/2009</li>
			<li>Minor bug fix to Airmail Small Packets, when uninstalled and
				error was displayed in admin.</li>
			<li>Major change in that parcelforce and all courier modules
				have now been removed and are to be found under ParcelForce shipping
				modules.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.3</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">29/03/2009 :</li>
			<li>Major change - all modules when installed are now "disabled"
				by default. The majority of "shop owners" are installing on live
				sites and so if they install a module it would appear on a
				customer's shopping trolley and checkout before the owner had a
				chance to check the figures or that the handling fees are correct.</li>
			<li>New Modules - ukcourier, this is a very basic module for
				shop owners that want a basic courier module without going to the
				trouble of setting up zones and placing the Scottish Highlands in a
				separate pricing zone.</li>
			<li>specialdeliverysat - This is BETA CODE, this module will
				appear to the customer after the post office has shut on a Thursday
				through to when it closes on a Friday, giving the option of Saturday
				Special Delivery, but it does rely on the server having the correct
				time and being in the UK, in the next release this will be
				corrected.</li>
			<li>Module Update - Standard Parcels now has a minimum weight
				setting. The royal mail calculates the price in a band from 0 to
				2Kg, whereas some shop owners may prefer to send items by 1st Class
				up to a kilo and then offer standard parcels, this new setting
				enables this scenario and will be migrated across all modules.</li>
			<li>Removals - the sql that removed all the royal mail details
				from the database and the sql for when people upgraded version that
				were 2~3 years old has been removed from the optional section after
				a newbie ran it on his live site by mistake and damaged his
				installation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.2</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">15/03/2009</li>
			<li>All airmail countries have been altered to move from Royal
				Mail's 2006 definitions to 2009. Airsure countries have been
				corrected, The code base for Airmail and International Signed has
				been altered to create a cleaner more accurate code, reflecting the
				Royal Mail's change from Europe, World Zone 1 &amp; World Zone 2, to
				Europe &amp; the Rest of the World.</li>
			<li class="da">12/03/2009</li>
			<li>International Datapost, International Standard and Eurozone
				48 all have to be upgraded because or a bug in the filename and
				bigroyal mail will not work unless the old files are removed before
				installing this release. See INSTALL.txt for the files to remove.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>version 2.3.1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="da">11/03/2009</li>
			<li>Airsure &pound;500 insurance had debugging information left
				in it that caused the zone tables to appear on the pages in Heading
				2 format.</li>
		</ul>
